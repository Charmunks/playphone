    <p>
        Reserve a spot in line <a href="javascript:alert('pretend this is a fillout form')">here.</a> Once it is your turn to build, you will be pinged in the <a href="javascript:alert('pretend this is a slack channel')">#playphone</a>
        channel. You will then have one week to do as much work on the game as you can.

    <p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>You must implement something that actually improves the game, no "I changed the player a tiny bit"</li>
            <li>No deleting other peoples work without good reason! It's not collaborative if you do everything yourself.</li>
            <li>You must make at least 1 commit within the first 3 days of your week, to prevent people from ghosting</li>
            <li>You must be 18 or under.</li>
